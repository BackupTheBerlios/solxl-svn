Introduction

This driver has been tested for the 3com 3c905B chipset only: namely "pci10b7,9055". 

To compile this driver, execute compile.sh after placing "/usr/sfw/bin" and "/usr/ccs/bin" in your path.

I have only tested this on AMD64, but the driver is stable and suffices for day to day usage. (For me at least).

DHCP et al works fine. 

Driver Installation

1. After compiling the driver, copy sol_xl to "/kernel/drv/" for IA32 users, "/kernel/drv/amd64/" for AMD64 users. (To compile for IA32, refer to compile.sh. By default it compiles for AMD64)
2. Remove the elxl driver from the driver alias list by "rem_drv elxl"
3. If you were previously running the elxl driver, and have rem_drv it, you must reboot for it to relinquish it's hold over the pci card
3. Add the sol_xl driver via "add_drv -i '"pci10b7,9055"' sol_xl"
4. Plumb the device via "ifconfig sol_xl0 plumb"
5. Do your static ip assignment or DHCP assignment as usual.
